# 01-Introduction

Oh hey, didn't see you there. Welcome to the nitty-gritty detail page of this coding assignment.

The purpose of the code in the main.py portion of this file is to simply inform the reader of my name, favorite game, concerns about this game technology class, share what I am excited about in said class, and to display my github and stackoverflow account info. The code does this by displaying the afformentioned information in a conversational format, occasionally giving the user a chance to input their own name and favorite game, which the program then uses in its own dialogue. That's really about it, so check it out for yourself.
